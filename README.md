# Retirement Plans in US - An Unsupervised Learning Approach

## Introduction

Retirement plans are an important part of the financial system for citizens and governments. At the individual level, a good retirement plan can provide people with enough means to maintain their lifestyle once they leave the workforce. At the government level, retirement plans have positive effects in the economy through investments and take away pressure from the fiscal system (people not only relying on government support after retirement). However, the number of retirements plans can be significant, and so their particularities.

## Conclusion

Machine learning tools can be useful for regulatory agencies around the world to detect behavioral patterns among a group of entities. This visibility can save time and resources for authorities. However, in order to be able to do so, the data collection process should become a priority for them. In this case, with the information available and a statistical method to solve for missing values, authorities can start detecting similiarities between the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (8), which as of June 2014 managed the largest public pension fund in the United States with $300.3 billion in assets, and others such as the New York State and Local Retirement System. Moreover, by clustering the retirement plans, regulatory agencies can distribute better their efforts. For example, an agency can set up a special department for the “big” systems, assign another group for the “middle sized” and so on. A more qualitative analysis is required to see if the pension systems are clustering in terms of size and income, or if there are other particularities and patterns that are dominating the relationship between them.
